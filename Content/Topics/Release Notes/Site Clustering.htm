        <h1>Site Clustering</h1>
        <h2>Using financial plans as a sales attribute to cluster sites</h2>
        <p>Financial plans can now be used as a sales attribute to cluster sites with new Attribute Type <span class="Emphasis">Financial Plan Attribute</span>. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Selecting <span class="Emphasis">Financial Plan Attribute</span> via the <span class="Emphasis">Add Attribute</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Edit Attribute</span> dialogs enables users to specify the financial plan and the time range to use. The hybrid financial plans listed are those plans that are in status <span class="Emphasis">Initialized</span>, <span class="Emphasis">In Progress</span>, or <span class="Emphasis">Authorized</span>. Once the cluster set is configured and users click <span class="Emphasis">Calculate</span> on the <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Set</span> window toolbar, the time range is used in conjunction with the financial plan to cluster sites.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The hybrid financial plans must have the exactly the same product hierarchy levels down to the selected clustering level. These plans can have lower levels of the product hierarchy as well but can’t be at a higher level than the required clustering. Time range selections need to be within the time range of the financial plan.</p>
