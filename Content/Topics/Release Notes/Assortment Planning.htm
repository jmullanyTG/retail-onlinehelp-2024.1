        <h1>Assortment Planning</h1>
        <h2>Defining default pricing relationships across currencies</h2>
        <p>Within Assortment Planning (AP), pricing decisions are important. Pricing might vary from one Cluster to another, and the complexities of various currencies and exchange rates also make pricing complex. ToolsGroup JustEnough has previously supported pricing strategies, without having to manage pricing individually, through the <span class="Emphasis">Price Point Matrix</span> screen (Price Matrix module). AP now provides better support for planning in multiple currencies.</p>
        <p>ToolsGroup JustEnough v2024.1 now supports an alternate process, <span class="Emphasis">Price Matrix</span>, to manage pricing. Instead of defining translation rules the users use a matrix to define pricing relationships across currencies.</p>
        <h3>Home AUT and Blended AUT</h3>
        <p>AP now distinguishes between two different types of AUT (or Average Unit Ticket, for example, the ticket price intended to be printed on merchandise tags). A new metric, <span class="Emphasis">Home AUT</span>, has been added and existing metric <span class="Emphasis">AUT</span> has been revised to be non-editable and renamed <span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span>. </p>
        <p>The first of these, <span class="Emphasis">Home AUT</span>, is meant to represent the AUT value for the country and currency of the defined Home Site as set in the <span class="Emphasis">Manage Assortment Plans</span> screen for AP.  This is the starting point for planning AUT, as this value is user-editable.  <span class="Emphasis">Home AUT</span> is only editable - and only has a value - in future periods. From this, <span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span> is derived.  </p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span> is considered to be a true representation of the expected earnings for a given item.  <span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span> incorporates several components, each of which is enabled by system policy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>VAT Rate changes between the Home Site and sites within each cluster</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Price Exception Factors</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Price Matrix conversions</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">Only Price Exceptions OR Price Matrix conversion can be enabled at once (but both can be disabled altogether if desired).  VAT Rate changes cannot be enabled if Price Matrix conversions are enabled.</p>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span> is derived in future periods from <span class="Emphasis">Home AUT</span>.  In past periods, as <span class="Emphasis">Home AUT</span> has no values, <span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span> is derived from provided sales history.</p>
        <p>These two metrics are available in the following views: Collection, Placeholder, Cluster Sets, Multi-Currency Price View, Sales Plan, and Top Down Core Plan.

Additionally, these metric have been added to the following read-only report views: 
Assortment Rollup and Reconciliation.</p>
        <h3>Price Matrix functionality
</h3>
        <p>If a user enables Price Matrix conversions via system policy <span class="Emphasis">Price Conversion Method</span>, and sets a Price Matrix on a given placeholder, then the configured Price Matrix is used to convert the provided <span class="Emphasis">Home AUT</span> value to <span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span>.
</p>
        <p>The following is a worked example to demonstrate the usage and value of this new functionality.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Multi-Currency Price Point Matrix Example.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>In the example, this indicates that USD $67.99 is equivalent to PLN zł270.  The matrix is meant to encapsulate both currency conversions and elegant rounding, or the standard price endings based on currency and locale, like ending prices in 99 cents in USD.</p>
        <p>The Price Matrix should be specified as a hierarchy default so that newly created placeholders can automatically inherit this property.  Then, when new placeholders are created with a given <span class="Emphasis">Home AUT</span>, a <span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span> value can automatically be created.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Multi-Currency Matrix Specified as Default.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">It is not necessary to set a Price Matrix Rounding rule.  If a Price Matrix is specified, but no Rounding rule is specified, then <span class="Emphasis">Nearest</span> is used.
</p>
        <p>
The specific usage of the Price Matrix can also be viewed in the <span class="Emphasis">Multi-Currency Price View</span>.  Users can see how, for each period, the Home AUT value converts into each specific currency's value. The <span class="Emphasis">Multi-Currency Price View</span> side view can be used to perform overrides to the established pricing rules.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Multi-Currency Price View.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">To reflect the introduction into AP of the Price Matrix functionality, the existing <span class="Emphasis">Price Exceptions</span> view was relabeled <span class="Emphasis">Multi-Currency Price View</span>.</p>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Multi-Currency Price View</span> also indicates whether any value was missing from the indicated Price Matrix value, for example, if a site in the cluster had currency GBP but this currency was not included in the Price Matrix.

</p>
        <p>After the AUT values are converted from <span class="Emphasis">Home AUT</span> values to currency-specific values using the Price Matrix, all AUT values are then converted back to Home currency using currency conversion rates, and a weighted average is used to calculate the cluster's combined <span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span> value.

</p>
        <p>Each period and cluster's <span class="Emphasis">Home AUT</span> values can be modified in the Sales Plan view, and <span class="Emphasis">Blended AUT</span> for each period and cluster can be viewed there as well.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h3>Viewing Price Matrix conversions</h3>
        <p>Users can review Price Matrix conversions via the following two new fields added to the main planning view: <span class="Emphasis">Price Matrix</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Price Matrix Rounding</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Price Matrix MPV UI.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <h3>Setting default price translation values</h3>
        <p>Users can set default parameters for the <span class="Emphasis">Price Matrix</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Price Matrix Rounding</span> fields via two new corresponding fields added to the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Plan Defaults</span> tab on the <span class="Emphasis">Manage Assortment Defaults</span> view. Setting default parameters saves having to manually set values each time. The defaults can still be changed later by users if needed.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Price Translation fields.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The new fields display on the far right (currently moved for screenshot purposes), and they follow the same coloring and editability rules as the other defaults. Both fields show a dropdown for default selection.</p>
        <h3>Choosing which price conversion method to use</h3>
        <p>Choosing whether to use Price Exception or Price Matrix as the price conversion method when deriving currency-specific AUT values from the given home AUT value is done using new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Price Conversion Method</span>. This system policy is referenced when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>a placeholder has the AUT/AUR values recalculated from any numerical metric change (e.g. change a phase date, change total sales, change AUT)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>a placeholder is created from Smart Start</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>daily maintenance runs, it only considers changed price translation factors if the feature is enabled</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Using VAT rate conversion when deriving currency-specific AUT values</h3>
        <p>New system policy <span class="Emphasis">Enable VAT Conversion In AUT Calculation</span> determines whether to use VAT rate conversion steps when deriving currency-specific AUT values from the given home AUT value. This system policy is referenced:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>when a placeholder has the AUT/AUR values recalculated from any numerical metric change (e.g. change a phase date, change total sales, change AUT) </li>
            <li>when a placeholder is created from a like style </li>
            <li>when a placeholder is created from Smart Start </li>
            <li>when the Home Site property is changed on an assortment plan </li>
            <li>when daily maintenance runs, it only considers changed VAT rates if the feature is enabled </li>
            <li>if a VAT rate is changed live in the UI, it only applies changes if VAT is enabled </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Price matrixes with insufficient data for all site currencies</h3>
        <p>If a Price Matrix is set for a placeholder, then the application attempts to use the Price Matrix data to convert AUT values. If any of the following components are missing, a new Health Error, <span class="Emphasis">Missing Data in Price Matrix</span>, displays in the <span class="Emphasis">Health Error</span> field:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>an entry in the matrix for the home site's country / currency</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>an entry in the matrix for the selling sites' country / currencies</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>a row in the matrix for the starting Home AUT value</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>currency conversion data for converting non-Home currency values back to the home currency</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Purging old or inactive curves in assortment planning and allocations <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.DoNotPublish">DMDEV-87973</MadCap:conditionalText></h2>
        <p>Functionality has been added to the existing job <span class="Emphasis">(Weekly) Maintenance: All Modules</span> to garbage collect inactive and deleted curves used both in assortment planning and allocations.</p>
        <p>The garbage collection process does the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>deletes references in curves table</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>deletes references from profile table</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>removes curve link tags</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>removes curves from allocation strategies and marks those strategies as missing configuration</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>removes curves from the assortment hierarchy, placeholders, rate of sale and both inventory and level forecast configuration</p>
            </li>

        <h2>Including the Attribute Lookup Description in the Manage Locations view</h2>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Locations &gt; Manage Locations</span> view has been updated to include the Attribute Lookup description which is much more meaningful to users than just the Lookup Code of a Site attribute. What displays is governed by new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Attribute Display</span> (Module: Assortment). See the <cite>System Policies</cite> section for more information.</p>
