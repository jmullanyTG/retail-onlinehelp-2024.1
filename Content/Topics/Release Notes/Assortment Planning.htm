        <h1>Assortment Planning</h1>
        <h2>Price Translation</h2>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Two fields have been added to the main planning view: <span class="Emphasis">Price Matrix</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Price Matrix Rounding</span>.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Price Matrix MPV UI.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <h3>Setting default price translation values</h3>
        <p>Users can set default parameters for the <span class="Emphasis">Price Matrix</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Price Matrix Rounding</span> fields via two new corresponding fields added to the <span class="Emphasis">Assortment Plan Defaults</span> tab on the <span class="Emphasis">Manage Assortment Defaults</span> view. Setting default parameters saves having to manually set values each time. The defaults can still be changed later by users if needed.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Price Translation fields.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The new fields display on the far right (currently moved for screenshot purposes), and they follow the same coloring and editability rules as the other defaults. Both fields show a dropdown for default selection.</p>
        <h3>Choosing which price conversion method to use</h3>
        <p>Choosing whether to use Price Exception or Price Matrix as the price conversion method when deriving currency-specific AUT values from the given home AUT value is done using new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Price Conversion Method</span>. This system policy is referenced when:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>a placeholder has the AUT/AUR values recalculated from any numerical metric change (e.g. change a phase date, change total sales, change AUT)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>a placeholder is created from Smart Start</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>daily maintenance runs, it only considers changed price translation factors if the feature is enabled</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3>Using VAT rate conversion</h3>
        <p>New system policy <span class="Emphasis">Enable VAT Conversion In AUT Calculation</span> determines whether to use VAT rate conversion steps when deriving currency-specific AUT values from the given home AUT value. This system policy is referenced:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>when a placeholder has the AUT/AUR values recalculated from any numerical metric change (e.g. change a phase date, change total sales, change AUT) </li>
            <li>when a placeholder is created from a like style </li>
            <li>when a placeholder is created from Smart Start </li>
            <li>when the Home Site property is changed on an assortment plan </li>
            <li>when daily maintenance runs, it only considers changed VAT rates if the feature is enabled </li>
            <li>if a VAT rate is changed live in the UI, it only applies changes if VAT is enabled </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Price matrixes with insufficient data for all site currencies</h3>
        <p>If a Price Matrix is set for a placeholder, then the application attempts to use the Price Matrix data to convert AUT values. If any of the following components are missing, a new Health Error, <span class="Emphasis">Missing Data in Price Matrix</span>, displays in the <span class="Emphasis">Health Error</span> field:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>an entry in the matrix for the home site's country / currency</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>an entry in the matrix for the selling sites' country / currencies</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>a row in the matrix for the starting Home AUT value</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>currency conversion data for converting non-Home currency values back to the home currency</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Purging old or inactive curves in assortment planning and allocations <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.DoNotPublish">DMDEV-87973</MadCap:conditionalText></h2>
        <p>Functionality has been added to the existing job <span class="Emphasis">(Weekly) Maintenance: All Modules</span> to garbage collect inactive and deleted curves used both in assortment planning and allocations.</p>
        <p>The garbage collection process does the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>delete references in curves table</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>delete references from profile table</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>removes curve link tags</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>removes curve from allocation strategy and marks strategy as missing configuration</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>removes curve from assortment hierarchy</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>removes curve from assortment placeholder</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>removes curve from rate of sale</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>removes  curve from inventory and level forecast configuration</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Including the Attribute Lookup Description in the Manage Locations view</h2>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Locations &gt; Manage Locations</span> view has been updated to include the Attribute Lookup description which is much more meaningful to users than just the Lookup Code of a Site attribute. What displays is governed by new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Attribute Display</span> (Module: Assortment). See <cite>System Policies</cite> for more information.</p>
