        <p>The garbage collection process does the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>delete references in curves table</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>delete references from profile table</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>removes curve link tags</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>removes curve from allocation strategy and marks strategy as missing configuration</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>removes curve from assortment hierarchy</p>
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>removes curve from rate of sale</p>
            </li>
            <li>

        <h2>Including the Attribute Lookup Description in the Manage Locations view</h2>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Locations &gt; Manage Locations</span> view has been updated to include the Attribute Lookup description which is much more meaningful to users than just the Lookup Code of a Site attribute. What displays is governed by new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Attribute Display</span> (Module: Assortment). See <cite>System Policies</cite> for more information.</p>
