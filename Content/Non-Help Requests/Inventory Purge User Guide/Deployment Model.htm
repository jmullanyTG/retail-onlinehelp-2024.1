        <h1>Deployment Model</h1>
        <p>The core code deployment includes executing the purge-specific <span class="EmphasisItalic">INIT</span> script.  By design, the initial setup deploys reference data, then adds the <span class="EmphasisItalic">prescription</span> to follow to effect Causal purges.</p>
        <p>When the solution is refreshed by a hot-fix or Service Pack, the same <span class="EmphasisItalic">INIT</span> script is run.  The script does what it can to preserve Custom prescription steps.  The only time such steps are removed is when we remove a core-code step-type.  By definition, removal of a step-type includes removal of any logic performed when that step-type existed in prior versions.</p>
        <p>The purge utility is not versioned separately from the overall solution version.</p>
        <p>We recommend that the <ins>Custom</ins> <span class="EmphasisItalic">INIT</span> script be kept under version control.  Any custom step that runs custom procedural code would recommend that the custom code also be managed under version control.</p>
        <p>The utility is provided in a form whereby successful execution of core code is the norm.  We are not responsible for any custom steps or code that act upon custom tables, or that act upon core tables but not within core code.  <span class="EmphasisUnderline">Complete and thorough testing of custom facets is required in a non-production environment prior to production usage.</span>  Data recovery of information losses due to custom artifacts is the responsibility of the customer where we have not been engaged to provide said custom artifacts in a thoroughly tested form.</p>
        <p>It is incumbent upon Support, for hosted implementations, or the on-premise Customer, to <span class="EmphasisItalic">review Job Manager Tasks</span> to ensure that the latter procedure is not directly referenced.  If it is, it must be removed.  It is recommended to only use Method names in Job Manager.</p>
        <p>Ensure that the <code>@UserID</code> value is assigned to the currently logged-in User ID, or accept that defaulting to <code>UserID = 1</code> reduces traceability in regards to the person explicitly starting the Task.  For the <span class="EmphasisItalic">Stop Now</span> Task, ensure that the parameter value is <span class="EmphasisItalic">True</span>.</p>
